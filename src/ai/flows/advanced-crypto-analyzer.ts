  prompt: `You are an expert technical analyst for cryptocurrency markets. Your task is to perform a comprehensive, multi-timeframe analysis for {{cryptoSymbol}} based on the candlestick data provided for the following timeframes: {{#each (Object.keys multiTimeframeCandlestickData)}}{{this}}{{#unless @last}}, {{/unless}}{{/each}}.

Your analysis must be holistic. Synthesize the information from all timeframes to provide a single, unified assessment. Do not just analyze each timeframe in isolation.

**Candlestick Data (JSON format [time, open, high, low, close, volume]):**
{{#each multiTimeframeCandlestickData}}
- **Timeframe: {{@key}}**
  {{this}}
{{/each}}

**Your analysis must cover:**
1.  **Overall Trend Identification**: Based on the confluence or divergence of trends across the timeframes, classify the *overall* current trend. For example, if short timeframes are bullish but long timeframes are bearish, you might classify it as 'neutral' or 'bullish with caution'.
2.  **Comprehensive Analysis**: In this main section, discuss your findings. How do the short-term patterns on the 5m and 15m charts fit into the larger structure of the 1hr and 6hr charts? Identify major support/resistance levels that are respected across multiple timeframes. Discuss volume trends and momentum indicators (RSI, MACD) in this multi-timeframe context.
3.  **Market Sentiment, Risk, and Price Prediction**: Provide a single assessment for each of these, derived from your combined analysis.
4.  **A Single AI Recommendation**: Based on everything, provide one clear recommendation: 'strong buy', 'buy', 'hold', 'sell', or 'strong sell'.
5.  **Concise Reasoning**: Briefly summarize how you weighed the different timeframes to arrive at your final recommendation.

Fill out all fields in the output schema with your detailed, synthesized analysis.
